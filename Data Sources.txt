What are the Sources of Data?
Sources of Data
The sources of data can be classified into two types: statistical and non-statistical. Statistical sources refer to data that is gathered for some official purposes, incorporate censuses, and officially administered surveys. Non-statistical sources refer to the collection of data for other administrative purposes or for the private sector.

What are the different sources of data?
The following are the two sources of data:

Internal sources
When data is collected from reports and records of the organisation itself, they are known as the internal sources.
For example, a company publishes its annual reportâ€™ on profit and loss, total sales, loans, wages, etc.
External sources
When data is collected from sources outside the organisation, they are known as the external sources. For example, if a tour and travel company obtains information on Karnataka tourism from Karnataka Transport Corporation, it would be known as an external source of data.
Types of Data
A) Primary data

Primary data means first-hand information collected by an investigator.
It is collected for the first time.
It is original and more reliable.
For example, the population census conducted by the government of India after every ten years is primary data.
B) Secondary data

Secondary data refers to second-hand information.
It is not originally collected and rather obtained from already published or unpublished sources.
For example, the address of a person taken from the telephone directory or the phone number of a company taken from Just Dial are secondary data.
